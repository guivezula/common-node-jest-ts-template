# Common node code

That's is a common node code template with typescript and jest. So it's possible to common start a projet which allows studies for javascript and tyscript. Also, there will be the opportunity to do unit tests for the implementations using jest.

## Scripts

### npm start

Starts the application

### npm run test

it runs the tests on files with .spec or .test

### npm run test:dev 

it runs the tests with watch mode

## Considerations

There is an example on ./src/sum which is implementing a test and it is running its test. Also, you are able to see an example to print the results on ./src/index.ts
